# Exploratory Data Analysis

This document describes the analytical capabilities integrated into the system.

## Statistical Analysis

The system performs real-time statistical analysis on the loaded dataset to inform the training process.

### Distribution Analysis

- **Target Balance**: Assessment of the ratio between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
- **Feature Distributions**: Analysis of the spread and central tendency of clinical features.

### Correlation Analysis

- **Feature-Target Correlation**: Identification of features with the highest predictive power.
- **Multicollinearity**: Detection of highly correlated independent variables.

## Visualization

The application generates dynamic visualizations to aid interpretation:

- **Probability Charts**: Visual representation of diabetes probability across all models.
- **Performance Comparison**: Bar charts comparing accuracy metrics across algorithms.
